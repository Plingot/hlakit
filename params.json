The [NESHLA](http://neshla.sourceforge.net/) compiler is a Windows-only application targeted only at the NES system and has lots of NES-specific features in both the language and the standard library.  I [ported the original NESHLA to Linux](http://bitbucket.org/wookie/neshla) in 2009 with the idea of extending it, but I soon decided it would be better to start from scratch in Python. HLAKit aims to be a compiler for a more general HLA (high level assembly) language targeted at as many old video game consoles and computers as possible.\r\n\r\nThe HLAKit compiler is implemented using the [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) Python module to handle all of the scanning and parsing.  The goal is to structure the compiler in such a way that all platform/CPU specific pieces of the language are modular and swappable.  Currently, the list of platform and/or CPU specific parts includes: assembly opcodes, register names, if/while test values, and preprocessor directives.  These will be explained in more detail later on.\r\n\r\nWhy do this?  An HLA language gives a nice balance between structured programming and assembly language.  It allows you to program using functions, structs, named variables, if-else blocks and loops while still preserving precise, cycle-counted control over the machine.  Unlike C, the HLA understood by the HLAKit compiler uses assembly for the body of functions.  When you are coding for old, 8-bit and 16-bit computers that have precise timing requirements, assembly language is the only way to be sure you are getting the most out of the machine.\r\n\r\n### Quick Start for the Impatient\r\n\r\nThe fastest way to get started with HLAKit is to clone the repo and install it.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/Wookie/hlakit.git\r\n$ cd hlakit\r\n$ sudo python ./setup.py install\r\n```\r\nThat's it.  You'll have to read the rest of the documentation to learn the language and how to use the compiler.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-10082522-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
